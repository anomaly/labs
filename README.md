<summary>Terraform reference implementation for Linode</summary>

The project aims to establish a standardised reference for using Terraform to provision and tear down infrastructure. 

The implementation will focus primarily on using Linode's infrastructure with the possibility of expanding to Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform if the need arises.

Our key outcomes for this project are:
- Document our understanding of Terraform with key steps to bootstrap a project
- Document Linode related specifics around Terraform
- Create a Template project that developers can use to speed up their setup
