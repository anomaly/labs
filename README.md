## Infrastructure

<details>
<summary>[projects/terraform-linode](Terraform reference implementation for Linode)</summary>

The project aims to establish a standardised reference for using Terraform to provision and tear down infrastructure. 

The implementation will focus primarily on using Linode's infrastructure with the possibility of expanding to Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform if the need arises.

Our key outcomes for this project are:
- Document our understanding of Terraform with key steps to bootstrap a project
- Document Linode related specifics around Terraform
- Create a Template project that developers can use to speed up their setup

<summary>Containerised application deployment</summary>

Anomaly uses [Docker](https://docker.com) to develop and deploy all it's web applications. Deployment of the these applications has varied between client projects. This lab exercise aims to strongly define and provide a reference implementation that:

- Outlines a git based lifecycle of a deployment i.e test, quality assurance, and production
- Clearly define the architecture while being cost effective
- How envrionment variables are made available to various parts of the application
- Role of Github or a deployment facility
- Mechanism of storing and reteriving infrastructure level secrets
